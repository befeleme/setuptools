Added automatic configuration for the ``name`` metadata
-- by :user:`abravalheri`.

Setuptools will adopt the name of the top-level package (or module in the case
of single-module distributions), **only when** ``name`` **is not explicitly
provided**.

Please note that it is not possible to automatically derive a single name when
the distribution consists of multiple top-level packages or modules.

Implicit namespaces (as introduced in :pep:`420`) are now considered by default
during :doc:`package discovery </userguide/package_discovery>`, when
``setuptools`` configuration and project metadata are added to the
``pyproject.toml`` file.

To disable this behaviour, use ``namespaces = False`` when explicitly setting
the ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`` section in ``pyproject.toml``.

This change is backwards compatible and does not affect the behaviour of
configuration done in ``setup.cfg`` or ``setup.py``.
